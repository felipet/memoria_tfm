	abstract = {The network time protocol (NTP), which is designed to 
	distribute time information in a large, diverse system, is described. It 
	uses a symmetric architecture in which a distributed subnet of time servers 
	operating in a self-organizing, hierarchical configuration synchronizes 
	local clocks within the subnet and to national time standards via wire, 
	radio, or calibrated atomic clock. The servers can also redistribute time 
	information within a network via local routing algorithms and time daemons. 
	The NTP synchronization system, which has been in regular operation in the 
	Internet for the last several years, is described, along with performance 
	data which show that timekeeping accuracy throughout most portions of the 
	Internet can be ordinarily maintained to within a few milliseconds, even in 
	cases of failure or disruption of clocks, time servers, or networks},

	abstract = {This paper describes a series of experiments involving 
	over$\backslash$n100,000 hosts of the Internet system and located in the 
	U.S., Europe and$\backslash$nthe Pacific. The experiments are designed to 
	evaluate the availability,$\backslash$naccuracy and reliability of 
	international standard time distribution$\backslash$nusing the DARPA/NSF 
	Internet and the Network Time Protocol (NTP), which$\backslash$nis 
	specified in RFC-1119. NTP is designed specifically for use in 
	a$\backslash$nlarge, diverse internet system operating at speeds from 
	mundane to$\backslash$nlightwave. In NTP a distributed subnet of time 
	servers operating in a$\backslash$nself-organizing, hierarchical, 
	master-slave configuration exchange$\backslash$nprecision timestamps in 
	order to synchronize subnet clocks to each other$\backslash$nand national 
	time standards via wire or radio. The experiments are$\backslash$ndesigned 
	to locate Internet hosts and gateways that provide time by 
	one$\backslash$nof three time distribution protocols and evaluate the 
	accuracy of their$\backslash$nindications. For those hosts that support 
	NTP, the experiments determine$\backslash$nthe distribution of errors and 
	other statistics over paths spanning$\backslash$nmajor portions of the 
	globe. Finally, the experiments evaluate the$\backslash$naccuracy and 
	reliability of precision timekeeping using NTP and 
	typical$\backslash$nInternet paths involving DARPA, NSFNET and other agency 
	networks. The$\backslash$nexperiments demonstrate that timekeeping accuracy 
	throughout most$\backslash$nportions of the Internet can be ordinarily 
	maintained to within a few$\backslash$ntens of milliseconds, even in cases 
	of failure or disruption of clocks,$\backslash$ntime servers or networks.
